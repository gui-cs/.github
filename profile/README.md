## Modern, cross-platform, terminal UIs using .NET and Swift since 2007.

The gui.cs organization hosts projects related to [gui.cs](http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2007/Apr-16.html) that [Miguel de Icaza](https://github.com/migueldeicaza) wrote for [mono-curses](https://github.com/mono/mono-curses) in 2007.

The original **gui.cs** was a single file and tied to the [curses library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curses_%28programming_library%29). Since then, gui.cs has been transformed into **Terminal.Gui**, a full-featured library for building modern, cross-platform, TUI applications.

A presentation of gui.cs was part of the [Retro.NET](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/dotnetConf/2018/S313) talk at .NET Conf 2018 [Slides](https://tirania.org/Retro.pdf)

The other projects in this organization are either dependencies of Terminal.Gui or related offshoots.

The maintainers welcome contributions from the community.
